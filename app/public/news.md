# Patch 3.4 - Shields Up

Release: 04/05/2023

## Newcomers

Welcome to Hoothoot and Noctowl ! ![Hoothoot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keldaanCommunity/SpriteCollab/master/portrait/0163/Normal.png)

## Dodge & Protect

- On-hit effects now don't work if attack is dodged or target is protected, giving a small buff to Water and a small nerf to Fire & Dragon
- Sleep duration reduction now only works if pokemon actually took damage (not dodged / protected)
- Minimum damage per attack is one, even with blocked damage by Fight synergy

## Stronger Shields

- Shield should be much effective now that we fixed the bug on damage on shield being counted twice
- Shell bell & human synergy heal now also takes into account the damage on shield
