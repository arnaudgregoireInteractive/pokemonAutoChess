# Patch 3.5

## Newcomers

Welcome to Hoothoot and Noctowl !

## Dodge & Protect

On-hit effects now don't work if attack is dodged or target is protected, giving a small buff to Water & a small nerf to Fire & Dragon

## No more zero damage

Minimum damage per attack is one, even with blocked damage by Fight synergy

## Shields up

Shield should be much effective now that we fixed the bug on damage on shield being counted twice
