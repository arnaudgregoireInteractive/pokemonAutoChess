# Gameplay

- New status: Blinded: reduce accuracy of basic attacks by 50%. Replace the existing Smoke effect that was not considered a status.
- New rank system: 12 different ranks, each with a different icon (by @joinity). Beast ball and Master ball players will create ranked games with Ultra ball.
  - Level ball: 0 ELO
  - Net ball: 1050 ELO
  - Safari ball: 1100 ELO
  - Love ball: 1150 ELO
  - Premier ball: 1200 ELO
  - Quick ball: 1250 ELO
  - Poké ball: 1300 ELO
  - Super ball: 1350 ELO

  - Master ball: 1500 ELO
  - Beast ball: 1700 ELO
- ELO, XP and titles after game are now distributed immediately after the player is eliminated and leaves the game, instead of waiting for the game to end
- Due to an increase of cases of intentional leaves at the start of a game, we have to increase the penalties for early disconnections. Intentional disconnections before stage 6 are no longer protected against Elo loss. Unintentional disconnections without reconnection within the next 3 minutes before stage 6 remain protected against Elo loss, but players won't be able to join a new game within the next 5 minutes.
