If they always loose, they'll improve much more slowly.",
    "create_bot": "Can i create my own bot ?",
    "create_bot_answer": "Sure. You'll need to be at least level 10 to unlock the Bot Builder title. Then choose this title and a \"Bot Builder\" button will appear in the header. Read the instructions and submit your bot, it will be sent in the #bot-creation channel on Discord for a review by the bot reviewers team.",
    "elo": "How does the elo system work ?",
    "elo_answer": "The elo system in Pokemon Auto Chess works the same as in other elo based games like Chess, Lol, Starcraft etc... To gain elo points, you need to beat other players. The higher your opponent's elo, the more elo you will gain by defeating him, and vice versa. If you don't play for 10 days, your elo will start to decay (-10 elo/day).",
    "missing_points": "I didn't get elo points in my last game, why ?",
    "missing_points_answer": "The game needs to be finished in order to win/lose elo points. If someone is still in game, you need to wait. Bots do not give elo, only human players are accounted for elo rating. It is also possible that the game had elo disabled (\"Just for fun\" mode)",
    "damage_label": "What are the special damages and physical damages ?",
    "damage_answer": "Auto attacks mostly deal Physical damage, while Abilities mostly deal Special damage. Some abilities however can deal true damage or physical damage.",

    "defense_answer": "Same system as League of Legends: damage: atk * (hp / hp * (1+(0.1*def))). Defense works for physical damage, special defense for special damage",
    "shiny": "How do you get shiny pokemons ?",
    "shiny_answer": "You get experience points by playing games. With enough experience, you level up and get a booster pack. Each booster pack gives shards for random pokemon. Use these shards to purchase the shiny emotes of a pokemon in the Collection page, then you will get that one pokemon as a shiny ingame.",
