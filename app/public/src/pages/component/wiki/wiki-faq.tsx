        <h4 className="nes-text is-success">How do the items works ?</h4>

          After winning a PVE round, you will get a random basic item and you
          will be able to choose from 3 choices another basic item that suits
          you. You can combine two basic items to create a powerfull tier 2
          items. The crafting list of all items is available in the wiki, in the

        </p>
        <h4 className="nes-text is-success">How do bots works ?</h4>
        <p>
          Bots are created by other players. Bots are theme-based, a mewtwo bot
          will always have an mewtwo in its team at a certain time in the game.
          Bots follows a list of predefined patterns. But they will not behave
          the same from one game to an other. To improve their team, they need
          to win matches against other bots/players. If they always loose,
          they'll improve much more slowly.
        </p>
        <h4 className="nes-text is-success">Can i create my own bot ?</h4>
        <p>
          Sure. Go to the bot builder in the lobby and try to make your own bot.

          a review by the bot reviewer team.

        <h4 className="nes-text is-success">How does the elo system work ?</h4>
        <p>
          The elo system in Pokemon Auto Chess works the same as in other elo
          based games like Chess, Lol, Starcraft etc... To gain elo points, you
          need to beat other bots/players. For example, if you finish 3rd, you
          won against 4th,5th,6th,7th,8th place and lost to 1st and 2nd place.
        </p>
        <h4 className="nes-text is-success">
          I didn't get elo points in my last game, why ?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The game needs to be finished in order to win/lose elo points. If
          someone is still in game, you need to wait. Only 8-players/bots game
          count are eligible to elo rating.

        <h4 className="nes-text is-success">How do you get shinys</h4>
        <p>
          So when you play games with 8 players/bots you get exp. When you get
          1000 exp you get a booster pack, each booster pack gives 4 40x tokens
          for random pokemon. Then if you purchase the shiny emotes of a pokemon
          (the normal one is 150) you get that one pokemon as a shiny.
