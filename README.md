Pick the pokémon you like in the following list: 

★ Caterpie - Metapod - Butterfree 
★ Weedle - Kakuna - Beedrill 
★ Pidgey - Pidgeotto - Pidgeot
★ Cleffa - Clefairy - Clefable
★ Igglybuff - Jigglypuff - Wigglytuff
★ Zubat - Golbat - Crobat
★ Graveler - Golem
★ Azurill - Marill - Azumarill
★ Mareep - Flaaffy - Ampharos
★ Hoppip - Skiploom - Jumpluff
★ Seedot - Nuzleaf - Shiftry
★ Starly - Staravia - Staraptor

Create a folder with the name "pokedex_number_of_your_pokemon", for ex: 12. 12 is Papilusion.

In the "12" folder create 2 subfolder :

    - "0" for moving sprites
    - "1" for attacking sprites
    - Add a portrait.png of the pokemon, representing the face of the pokemon

For both subfolder, create 4 subfolder:

    - "0" for moving down sprites
    - "1" for moving down left sprites
    - "2" for moving left sprites
    - "3" for moving up left sprites
    - "4" for moving up sprites

For each subsubfolder, you should put 3 sprites of the pokemon, corresponding to the folder name they belong. For example, in the "12/1/2", there will be 3 sprites of a Papilusion attacking left.

 Name each sprite with a number in order(so 0,1,2).

Warning, you must save them in a .png. And the background of the sprite must be transparent.

Lets recap, at the end you should have the following structure:

- "pokemon index":
    - 0:
        - 0: 3 sprites moving down named 0,1,2
        - 1: 3 sprites moving down left named 0,1,2
        - 2: 3 sprites moving left named 0,1,2
        - 3: 3 sprites moving up left named 0,1,2
        - 4: 3 sprites moving up named 0,1,2
    - 1:
        - 0: 3 sprites moving down named 0,1,2
        - 1: 3 sprites moving down left named 0,1,2
        - 2: 3 sprites moving left named 0,1,2
        - 3: 3 sprites moving up left named 0,1,2
        - 4: 3 sprites moving up named 0,1,2

Once you're finished, zip your folder and send it to deoxys226@gmail.com.
